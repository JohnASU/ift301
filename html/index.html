  <h1>Friday, March 6th 2020:</h1>
  <p>
    That was the last normal day for our family. I walked out of work
    intending to take a week off for Spring Break. I picked my daughter up
    from school who was also starting her Spring Break. We stopped at our
    normal places on the way home. When we entered the house we had no idea it
    would be last time we went outside for the foreseeable future.
