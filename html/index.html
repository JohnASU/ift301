    <h1>Covid19 Take Over</h1>
    <h2>Mid-April to End of Spring B 2020:</h2>
    <p>The term is wrapping up at ASU and Amazon deliveries are down to 2-4 days. Signs are looking like survival is likely. My daughter has been taking 4th grade entirely online for over a month now.</p>
    <h2>Mid-March to Early-April 2020:</h2>
    <p>I have notified work that my return is postponed until such time as the current situation stabalizes. Some changes to normal life have been:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>SUSD has closed for remainder of school year</li>
      <li>Extended family is returning from abroad</li>
      <li>F1 season has been postponed</li>
      <li>March Madness cancelled</li>
      <li>Amazon delivery times are 2-4 weeks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And most importantly...my daughter is home all day, every day. The swimming pool, backyard, and Xbox Live are all that stands between her and the realization that she is totally bored.</p>
    <h2>Spring Break 2020:</h2>
    <p>ASU was moved fully online. This did not change much since I am an online student. However, my daughter just had her school shutdown for the next two weeks. I notified my work that I would be taking the next few weeks off.</p>
    <h3>Update:</h3>
    <p>SUSD just shutdown classes until early April. I have notified work that I will be extending my leave as well.</p>
    <h2>March 6th, 2020:</h2>
    <p>
      That was the last normal day for our family. I walked out of work
      intending to take a week off for Spring Break. I picked my daughter up
      from school who was also starting her Spring Break. We stopped at our
      normal places on the way home. When we entered the house we had no idea it
      would be last time we went outside for the foreseeable future.
